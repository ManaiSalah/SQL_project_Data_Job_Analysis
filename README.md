3. What skills are most in demand for data analysis?
4. Wich skills are associated with higher salaries ?
5. What are the most optimal skills to learn ?
# Tools I used

- **SQL** for querying and analysis
- **PostgreSQL** for data storage and manipulation
- **Git & Github**


# The Analysis

FROM job_postings_fact
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim on job_postings_fact.job_id=skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id=skills_dim.skill_id
WHERE job_title_short='Data Analyst' and job_work_from_home=TRUE
GROUP BY skills
ORDER BY demand_count DESC
LIMIT 5
